## My first exercise without any type of help.

I'm so glad to be enrrolled in this course. I'm learning a lot, and my desire to continue learning is on the rise!

This small application has two models, `User` and `Post`.

Users should be able to:

- **Create posts**

- **List all the posts** (displaying the title and author - each post should belong to a user)

- **Update their own posts**

- **Show the details page of a specific post**

If someone is not logged in, **he/she can only see posts, but not edit them.**
